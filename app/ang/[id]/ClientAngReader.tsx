/**
 * app/ang/[id]/ClientAngReader.tsx
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Client-side reader body that powers **Continuous Reading Mode** (feature 2).
 *
 * The server page renders the initial Ang's verses statically; this component
 * holds that list in state and — when the end sentinel says we hit the bottom
 * — appends the *next* Ang's verses inline (fetched via the `getAngForReader`
 * server action) instead of navigating to a new page.  The chain keeps growing
 * until the user reaches Ang 1430 or disables continuous mode.
 *
 * The next Ang's data is preloaded in the background while the user is still
 * reading (see the preload effect), so reaching the bottom appends instantly
 * instead of stalling on a live upstream round-trip exactly at the moment of
 * arrival.  Preloaded verses are immutable scripture, so reuse is always safe.
 *
 * It also reports completed Angs to `ProgressProvider.markAngRead` so the
 * reading-progress/streak/history features (7/8/9/13) see every Ang the user
 * reads to the end, in both single-page and continuous modes.
