/**
 * app/ang/[id]/AngStartSentinel.tsx
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * An invisible, renderless component that detects when the user scrolls back
 * to the very top of the Ang page and navigates to the *previous* Ang.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   1. Watches for a downward scroll first (so opening the page at the top
 *      does not immediately navigate away).
 *   2. Once the user has scrolled down, a subsequent upward scroll that
 *      reaches within 8px of the top triggers the "crossfade-start" event
 *      and pushes `/ang/{N-1}`.
 *   3. Each scroll-back can only fire once per mount (guarded by `triggered` ref).
 *   4. No navigation happens if we are already at `minAng` (Ang 1).
 *
 * The "crossfade-start" CustomEvent is consumed by `PageTransition.tsx`,
 * which briefly fades the screen to simulate a gentle cross-fade.
